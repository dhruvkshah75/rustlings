# Rustlings 🦀

Greetings! This repository contains my solutions and progress through the **rustlings** course—a series of small exercises to get accustomed to reading and writing Rust code.

## About this Repo

This project is based on the official [rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) curriculum. The goal is to solve various programming challenges that cover the core concepts of Rust, from basic variables to advanced topics like threads and macros.

## Structure

* `exercises/`: The core challenges divided by topic (e.g., variables, functions, ownership).
* `solutions/`: My completed versions of the exercises.
* `Cargo.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies.

## How I use this

To run the exercises and check my progress, I use the `rustlings` watcher:

1. **Run the watcher:**
```bash
rustlings watch

```
